- What are your initial impressions of how `Encapsulation` affects your programming?

It is very interesting to see how classes, methods objects all work off of each other and how encapsulation is able to create something as elaborate as a virtual train.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
Main function testing was diifciult for me and a lot of variables couldnt be reoslved to a type for some reason, I also struggled a lot wiht the train class but TA hours helped me a lot as well as the discord chat.
